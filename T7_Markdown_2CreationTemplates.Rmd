### Basics

To create a new R Markdown document in RStudio:

![](index_images/pg_Tut4_markdown_fig1.png)

1.  **Go to** `File` → `New File` → `R Markdown...`
2.  **Choose a document type** (HTML, PDF, or Word). For now, \| select `HTML`.
3.  **Give your document a title** and specify the author as \| your Email ID e.g. hlg5155
4.  **Click `OK`**
5.  *If this is your first time ever doing this or you're running a new POSIT-Cloud project, then R-studio might ask to download some packages before it can do this this. Say yes.*
6.  A new file should appear on your screen. At the top of that window (by the knit button, there is a save button. Save it as something relevant INSIDE YOUR PROJECT FOLDER!

RStudio will generate a default R Markdown file with an example of formatted text and an embedded code chunk.

#### **Important**

-   Before you continue, on your computer (outside R-Studio), go to your project folder

-   MAKE SURE THE RMD FILE SAVED IN YOUR PROJECT FOLDER. Also, check you didn't accidentally create a load of
    sub-folders inside your lab. If so, delete/move things around until it looks like this.

#### **Important!**

Sometimes rmdformats makes an extra subfolder and puts your report in there.

-   So before you continue, on your computer (outside R-Studio), go to your project folder

-   MAKE SURE THE RMD FILE SAVED IN YOUR PROJECT FOLDER. Also, check you didn't accidentally create a load of
    sub-folders inside your lab. If so, delete/move things around until it looks like this.
