## Introduction to the workspace

Now everything is installed, open R-studio (NOT R!). Or open a new workspace in Posit-Cloud

![](index_images/pg_Tut2_startup_fig1.png)

You will be greeted by three panels:

-   The interactive R console (entire left)
-   Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
-   Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

If you wish to learn more about what these windows do, have a look at this resource, from the Pirates Guide to R:
<https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/the-four-rstudio-windows.html>.\

If you have used R before, you might see that there are variables and plots etc already loaded\*\*. It is always good to
clear these before you start a new analysis. To do this, click the little broom symbol in your environment tab

## Adjusting the four panes

Look at the VERY TOP OF THE SCREEN.

-   In the`View` menu, there is a `/Panes/Pane Layout` menu item, where you can move the on-screen quadrants around. I
    tend to like the console to be top left and scripts to be top right, with the plots and environment on the bottom -
    but this is personal choice.

-   There should also be a menu called `Help`<br>Useful for R-studio version and Markdown cheatsheets.
