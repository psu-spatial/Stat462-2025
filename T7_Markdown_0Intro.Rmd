### What is R-Markdown?

Typing commands into the console is like making a phone call to the computerâ€”you communicate but don't keep a record of your interactions. To save your commands for future use, we use scripts and documents. There are several types:

-   **A basic script** (`.R` file): A blank notepad where you save code commands. When you "run" the script, R simply
    copies and pastes the commands into the console.

-   **An R Notebook or R Markdown document** (`.Rmd` file): An interactive document where you can combine text, code,
    and output in one place. With a single click, you can convert `.Rmd` files into reports, websites, blogs,
    presentations, or interactive applications.

R Markdown is especially useful for labs because it allows you to integrate code, output, and written analysis seamlessly. Instead of taking screenshots, you can embed results directly in your document.
