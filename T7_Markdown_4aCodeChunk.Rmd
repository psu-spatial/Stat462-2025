### Adding new code chunks

In visual mode, you can add code chunks by clicking on the little green button at the top right and choosing R.

In source mode, you can add a code chunk by typing

![](index_images/im_T3_CodeChunkCreateB.png){width="49%"}

Where the little symbols before the {R} are called BACK-TICKS. I often just copy/replace.

### Running code chunks

There are several ways you can run the code in a code chunk. The easiest is to use the controls on each chunk.

-   **To run that chunk** → Click the **green "Play" (▶) button** in the top-right corner of the chunk.

-   **To Run all chunks above** → Click the small **downwards arrow** next to the left of the Play button.

Or via the Run menu on the top right.
