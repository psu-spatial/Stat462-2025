# Probability distributions

## What are they?  Full info

We have talked about several distributions and tests so far in the lab. To see the help files for most of them, see `?Distributions`.

## The normal distribution {#T5_NormalDist}

Remember as we discussed in lectures, we normally state that a variable modelled using by a normal distribution is described by:

X∼N(μ,σ^2^)

In this expression:

-   X is the random variable.

-   ∼ means "is distributed as."

-   N represents the normal distribution.

-   μ is the mean of the distribution.

-   σ^2^ is the VARIANCE of the distribution.

**In R commands, you need the standard deviation instead. (you can google how to get the sd from the variance if you have forgotten)**

<br>

### Help file

To see the help file for all normal related functions:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
?Normal
```

<br>

### Generate a random sample

To generate a random sample from a normal distribution we use rnorm:

```{r}
# random sample of size 100
sample.normal <- rnorm(n=100,mean=4,sd=2)
```

<br>

### Calculate probability when given a z-score

To calculate a z score from your sample/population, you can use R as a calculator.

To calculate the probability of greater/lesser than a value in a given normal distribution (e.g. you can use this as an interactive table)

```{r}
# probability of less than 1.7 in a normal distribution with mean 4 and standard deviation = 2 
pnorm(1.7,mean=4,sd=2,lower.tail = TRUE)

# probability of GREATER than 1.8 in a normal distribution with mean 4 and VARIANCE = 9
1 - pnorm(1,mean=4,sd=3,lower.tail = TRUE)

# or
pnorm(1,mean=4,sd=2,lower.tail = FALSE)
```

<br>

### Calculate z-score when given a probability

Inversely, to calculate the z-score for a given probability

```{r}
# what value is less than 60% of the data?
qnorm(0.6,mean=4,sd=2,lower.tail = TRUE)

# what value is greater than 80% of the data?
qnorm(0.8,mean=4,sd=2,lower.tail = FALSE)
```

<br><br>

### Testing normality

#### Wilks Shapiro test for normality

To test for normality:

First, have a look at the histogram! Here is the code for the Shapiro-Wilk test.

```{r}
shapiro.test(HousesNY$Price)
```

There are many online tutorials for interpretation

<br>

####  QQ-Norm plot

You can also make a QQ-Norm plot. Instal the ggpubr package, add it to your library code chunk and run.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggpubr)
ggqqplot(HousesNY$Price,col="blue")
```

YOU CAN INTERPRET IT HERE: <https://www.learnbyexample.org/r-quantile-quantile-qq-plot-base-graph/>

<br><br>

## T-distribution {#TDist}

What even is this? See this nice resource: <https://365datascience.com/tutorials/statistics-tutorials/students-t-distribution/>

To see the help file for all these:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
?TDist
```

### Calculate a probability given a T-Statistic

To calculate a t-statistic from your sample/population, you can use R as a calculator. To calculate the probability of greater/lesser than a value in a given t-distribution (e.f. you can use this as an interactive t-table)

```{r}
# probability of seeing less than 1.7 in a  t-distribution 
# with 20 degrees of freedom
pt(1.55,df=20,lower.tail = TRUE)

```

<br>

### Calculate a T-Statistic for a given probability

To calculate the value for a given probability

```{r}
# what value is greater than 90% of the data in a t-distribution with df=25
qt(0.9,df=25,lower.tail = TRUE)
```

<br>

### One sided T-test

To conduct a full t-test on some data:

```{r}

# Conduct a two-sided t-test where we think that the data comes from a T-distribution with mean 100.
t.test(HousesNY$Price,mu=100,alternative="two.sided")
```

or see the detailed tutorial here: <http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/one-sample-t-test-in-r> for one-sample

and here for comparing two samples: <http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/unpaired-two-samples-t-test-in-r>
