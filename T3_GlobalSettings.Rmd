## Changing settings

R-studio wants to be helpful and will try to re-load exactly where you were in a project when you log back in.  This can get confusing, so we are going to turn this off.

 - **ON A MAC:** Click on the R-studio menu button on the top left of the screen, then click Preferences. 

 - **ON A PC/R-Studio Cloud:** Click on Tools-> Global Options -> Preferences

Now:

 - UNCLICK "Restore most recently opened project at startup"
 - Set "Save workspace to .RData on" exit to Never
 - You can also click the appearances tab to change how the screen looks.
