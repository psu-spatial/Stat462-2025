### ii. Adjusting the four panes

Look at the VERY TOP OF THE SCREEN.  

  - In the`View` menu, there is a `/Panes/Pane Layout` menu item, where you can move the on-screen quadrants around.  I tend to like the console to be top left and scripts to be top right, with the plots and environment on the bottom - but this is  personal choice. 

 -  There should also be a menu called `Help`<br>Useful for R-studio version and Markdown cheatsheets.
